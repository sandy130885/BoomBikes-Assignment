# Boom Bikes Assignment
> BoomBikes MLR AssignmentÂ¶
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
